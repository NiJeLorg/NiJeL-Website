At the local level, we work to improve our partner's communities and constituencies through data and technology, and we aim to democratize the tools and data needed to to make better social and environmental decisions. We're also always working to bridge the “data divide” and provide everyone the ability to tell their stories and visualize their impacts for advocacy and representation.</p><p>We achieve this vision by developing custom systems for data visualization, analysis, and participation for our partners, and teaching our partners to harness their data through "data therapy" to document their program impacts, build strong advocacy tools, and connect with their key audiences. It's also critically important to us that we build strong personal relationships with our partners to develop a technology roadmap for them that aligns with their current workflow and mission.</p><p>At the heart of everything we do at NiJeL are our core values of:</p><ul><li><strong>Being considerate, cooperative, and contentious</strong> in work with us, our team, and our partners,</li><li><strong>Respect</strong> for others and their ways of working and using technology</li><li><strong>Curiosity</strong> to learn new ways of working and try new things,</li><li><strong>Flexibility</strong> to change direction and technology when needed.</li></ul></md-content></md-tab><md-tab label="Our Process"><md-content class="md-padding"><h1 class="md-display-2">Our Process</h1><div class="image-container"><img src="assets/our-process.svg"/></div><p>All organizations and communities generate data, but most don't fully understand how to use it to become more effective and better advocates. Our goal is to help our partners harness their data to document their impacts, build strong advocacy tools, and connect with their communities. We follow a flexible core approach that we adapt to each unique partner and project.</p><p>Our process starts with a thorough assessment of how your organization works and communicates. We listen to our partners, working directly with organizational staff to get a deep understanding of their current data situation and future data and application needs. We call this process "data therapy," and it is critical to determining what technologies would be useful and appropriate for your organization.</p><p>We use this process to develop a technology roadmap that aligns with your current tools and ways of working. We then build a strong foundation for your data management based on this assessment. Once this is in place we create tools for you and your team to visualize and analyze your data and share your story.</p><p>Our team will work with you to ensure that this custom system fits into the way your organization works and with the technology you currently have in place. We develop strong personal relationships with the organizations we serve in order to determine their needs and build sustainable systems that are flexible to future improvements in technology. We work directly with our partners - we learn the culture of their organizations and listen to their missions.</p><p>The NiJeL process makes our partners more efficient, better decisions-makers, and empowers them to visualize their impact as it changes over time and scale. So, if you're working to make the world a better place, we would like to partner with you to tell your story through your data.</p></md-content></md-tab><md-tab label="Technology"><md-content class="md-padding"><h1 class="md-display-2">Technology</h1><p>While every project is unique, we use standard statistics, mapping, and database software, and develop custom open applications for websites, mobile phones, and desktop computing.</p><p>NiJeL is cutting-edge but cutting-edge to us doesn’t always mean the new shiny toys - it means knowing what’s relevant to our partners’ needs. We use the relevant tools for the task at hand, keeping in mind new tools and more traditional ones - both analog and digital - particularly those that bridge this “data divide.”</p><p>We strongly support open source software and hardware solutions that put the tools and blueprints for these tools into the hands of everyone.</p></md-content></md-tab><md-tab label="Partner with NiJeL"><md-content class="md-padding"><h1 class="md-display-2">Partner with NiJeL</h1><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
