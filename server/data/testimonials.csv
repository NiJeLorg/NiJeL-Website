"",Council Member,Jumaane D. Williams,New York’s housing crisis is made worse by compounding issues of inequality and segregation of neighborhoods. The data will help address issues that disproportionately affect low-income New Yorkers and black and brown communities.
Cooper Square Committee,Director of Organizing,Brandon Kielbasa,"The DAP Map has already shown us a correlation we've long understood exists around the loss of affordable housing in New York City, that high volumes of renovation and construction often goes hand-in-hand with the depletion of affordable, rent regulated housing, a fact that should inform the city policy discussion."
""," Director of D3",Erica Raleigh,"“Regional thinking is critical, Understanding how we compare to other regions can lead to localized action, and integrating the Opportunity Index and the One D Scorecard allows just that – we can see exactly where we need to foster greater opportunity within metro Detroit.\n"
